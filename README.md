OpenMC is a professional Minecraft Server Network full of all the things you love!
We are more than just your ordinary, run of the mill, Minecraft world, we offer an experience similar to bigger servers like Hypixel and The Hive.
- Our server is a Waterfall Network (a fork of BungeeCord), this means we have tons of different gamemodes and minigames to play!
- We aren't using an outside provider to host our server, I have purchased a few rackmounted servers, which I personally placed into a data center, this means that I personally own all the hardware already so there will be no issues in terms of hosting.
- Each rackmounted server has two server grade Intel Xeon processors and 64 GB of RAM, which means there will be no performance issues whatsoever.
